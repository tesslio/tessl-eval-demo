description: Dispatch a code-reviewer subagent with precisely scoped context (git SHAs, task description, requirements) to review a diff and return Critical, Important, and Minor findings. Use after delivery-flow finishes implementing and verifying a task, before merging to main. This is the internal code-review stage of the delivery-flow workflow. It is not a standalone entry point, so do not activate it directly for a one-off "review this PR" or "review my code" request; use delivery-flow for those instead.

# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch a code reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code reviewer subagent:**

Dispatch a `general-purpose` subagent, filling the template at [code-reviewer.md](references/code-reviewer.md)

**Placeholders:**
- `{DESCRIPTION}` - Brief summary of what you built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` - What it should do
- `{BASE_SHA}` - Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` - Ending commit

**3. Act on feedback, in order:**
1. Fix all Critical issues immediately
2. Fix all Important issues before proceeding
3. Record Minor issues for later
4. Push back with technical reasoning if the reviewer is wrong

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

You: Let me request code review before proceeding.

BASE_SHA=$(git log --oneline | grep "Task 1" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch code reviewer subagent]
  DESCRIPTION: Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/plans/deployment-plan.md
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I'll just review the diff myself" | Reviewing inline burns the context you need to keep driving the work. Dispatch a subagent instead — only the findings come back. |
| "The reviewer needs my session history" | Hand it precisely crafted context, never your session's history. |

## Red Flags

**Never:** skip review because "it's simple", ignore Critical issues, proceed with unfixed Important issues, or argue with valid feedback.

**If the reviewer is wrong:** push back with technical reasoning, show code/tests that prove it works, or request clarification.
